# discord-first-bot

My first discord bot in javascript!

This first bot was developed using the discord.js library. 
I followed their guide to get to this results.

## Usage

Start by installing the dependencies:
  
    npm install
  
Then run the bot:

    npm run start
  
You can also user `pm2` to start, stop, restart, watch changes and monitor the bot.
